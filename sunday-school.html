      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the magnitude of God's creations (Psalm 8:3-4), God still
        humbles Himself to behold the activities of man on earth (Psalm
        113:5-6). A proud person is therefore repulsive to Him and He resists
        such an individual. Lucifer was cast out of Heaven because of pride
        (Isaiah 14:12-14). The Ancient Greek word for 'pride' is 'Hubris': it
        discribes a personality of dangerous overconfidence or an over inflated
        self-confidence, synonymous with arrogance. God intentionally builds a
        wall of resistance against the proud.

      <p class="">
        The Bible gives records of some characters that were filled with
        "hubris' and their ends. These include King Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel
        4:30), King Belshazzar (Daniel 5:22-23), Goliath (1 Samuel 17:41-44),
        the rich fool in Jesus' parable (Luke 12:16-19), and King Herod (Acts
        12:21-23a). These men were resisted and judged by God for their sin of
        pride (Ezekiel 28:17; Jeremiah 13:15-16); King Nebuchadnezzar was
        brought low and he ate grass (Daniel 4:31-32). King Belshazzar was slain
        (Daniel 5:30). Goliath and the rich fool in Jesus' parable died (1
        Samuel 17:50: Luke 12:20) while Herod was eaten by worms and he died
        (Acts 12:23b). Pride is rebellion against God and a bid to share in His
        glory Furthermore, God reserves the following punishment for the
        proud.He cuts them off by silencing them (Psalm 12:3). They are known at
        a distance and kept in derision (Psalm 138:6). He will destroy their
        house (Proverbs 15:25). He will bring them down (Isaiah 2:12). He will
        cause their arrogance to cease (lsaiah 13:11). He is against them and
        will make them stumble (Jeremiah 50:31-32). He will demean them (Daniel
        4:37).They shall be wasted like debris and straw (Malachi 4:1). God sets
        Himself in battle array against the proud (Obadiah 1:2-4). He repels
        those who live in pride and self-sufficiency by trusting in themselves
        and despising others. Pride is sin (Proverbs 21:4), and thus, the proud
        is abominable to God (Proverbs 16:5a).

        <span class="title">Lesson Outline 2:</span
        ><span class="upper-case bold"> BE HUMBLE</span>
      </p>

      <p class="">
        Humility is the antidote for pride and a requirement to walk with God
        (Micah 6:8). To be humble is simply a lack of pride, a state marked by
        meekness or modesty without any iota of arrogance (Colossians 3:12). It
        is the attitude of having no special importance that makes you better
        than others (Philippians 2:5-8). Unlike pride which puts a barrier (a
        wall of resistance) between man and God, humble people receive grace
        from God (1 Peter 5:5b). He forgives their sins and heals their land (2
        Chronicles 7:14). He hears when they call (2 Chronicles 34:27; Psalm
        9:12). God will save them (Job 22:29). He guides and teaches them His
        way (Psalm 25:9). Furthermore, humility comes before honour (Proverbs
        18:12; Philippians 2:7-11) and it brings riches and life (Proverbs
        22:4). However, being humble must be a conscious and deliberate resolve;
        Jesus says whoever humbles himself as a little child, is greatest in the
        kingdom of Heaven (Matthew 18:4). Humility must be worn like a garment
        every day (1 Peter 5:5b).

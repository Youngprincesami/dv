            `The Christian walk is very unique. This is because Christianity is dependent on an individual's ability to believe. As a result of this, Christians are generally called 'believers'. A scientist might say, "Prove it to me, and will believe you," but in Christendom, God says, "Believe Me, and I will prove it to you." This is the mystery of Christianity.`,

            `To an unbeliever, our faith is proof that we, as Christians, are not wise. This is because a natural man cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14). However, in 1 Corinthians 1:27, the Bible tells us that God uses the foolish things of this world to confound the wise. For example, it does not make sense to unbelievers when we say that a virgin gave birth to Jesus Christ. Most times, they think to themselves, "How can a virgin give birth?"`,

            `Jesus said something very important in our memory verse for today. He said that only those who are like children will inherit the kingdom. In other words, you must believe Him like a child believes his or her parents, whether what they say makes sense or not. Many people make the mistake of trying to relate with God logically. This is impossible because the Bible says that God's ways and thoughts are beyond human comprehension (lsaiah 55:8-9).`,

            `There are people who argue against Christianity with logic. Do not argue with such people because you cannot explain Christianity logically. Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:23- 25 to avoid unnecessary arguments with people concerrning the truth of God's word. The way to prove that God is real is not through arguments but by the display of power as Elijah did in 1 Kings 18. Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:20: “For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power:" Furthermore, John 4:48 says, "...Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe." No matter how hard you try, you cannot Win anyone to Christ by an argument. Once you have shared the gospel of Christ with unbelievers, commit their hearts to God, as it is only the Holy Spirit that can convict and convert them. Do not argue with them about your Christian faith, rather, ask God to use you for signs and wonders so that when they see the power of God, they will surrender without any argument.`,

            `Beloved, I pray that the power of God will be evident in your life and that He will use you to lead many people into HiS kingdom, in Jesus'name.`

            `Hearing is critical to all humans. For example, you will immediately know that you need to get out of the way when you hear the blare of a car's horn behind you.

            `Due to my training as a mathematician, I have learnt to delve into things that are not obvious. For instance, many Christians miss out on the fact that Elisha and Elijah were talking as they walked together in 2 Kings 2:11. When I studied that Scripture, I wondered what their discussion was about. Also, in Daniel 3, when the three Hebrew men were with the fouth man in the fire, what were they talking about? What did Jesus discuss with Moses and Eljah in Matthew 17:1-9? What was so crucial that they came down fromn heaven to discuss with Jesus? In 2 Corinthians 12:1-4, Paul said that he heard words that were not lawful for a man to speak. What were those words? In Revelation 10:4, John heard some things and wanted to write them down, but the angel told him they were not to be written; they were for his ears alone. What did he hear? I am really curious about these and many more of such conversations.`,

The Bible teaches that if you believe, you will see the glory of God John 11:40). However, this faith comes by hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17). Psalm 107-20 says, "He sent His word, and He healed and delivered them." The question is, how do you receive God's word?`,

      <p class="open-heaven-first-parag">
        The Christian walk is very unique. This is because Christianity is
        dependent on an individual's ability to believe. As a result of this,
        Christians are generally called 'believers'. A scientist might say,
        "Prove it to me, and will believe you," but in Christendom, God says,
        "Believe Me, and I will prove it to you." This is the mystery of
        Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
        To an unbeliever, our faith is proof that we, as Christians, are not
        wise. This is because a natural man cannot understand the things of the
        Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14). However, in 1 Corinthians 1:27, the
        Bible tells us that God uses the foolish things of this world to
        confound the wise. For example, it does not make sense to unbelievers
        when we say that a virgin gave birth to Jesus Christ. Most times, they
        think to themselves, "How can a virgin give birth?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus said something very important in our memory verse for today. He
        said that only those who are like children will inherit the kingdom. In
        other words, you must believe Him like a child believes his or her
        parents, whether what they say makes sense or not. Many people make the
        mistake of trying to relate with God logically. This is impossible
        because the Bible says that God's ways and thoughts are beyond human
        comprehension (lsaiah 55:8-9).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are people who argue against Christianity with logic. Do not argue
        with such people because you cannot explain Christianity logically. Paul
        told Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:23- 25 to avoid unnecessary arguments with
        people concerrning the truth of God's word. The way to prove that God is
        real is not through arguments but by the display of power as Elijah did
        in 1 Kings 18. Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:20:
        <strong
          ><i>
            “For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power:"</i
          ></strong
        >
        Furthermore, John 4:48 says,
        <strong
          ><i
            >"...Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe."</i
          ></strong
        >
        No matter how hard you try, you cannot Win anyone to Christ by an
        argument. Once you have shared the gospel of Christ with unbelievers,
        commit their hearts to God, as it is only the Holy Spirit that can
        convict and convert them. Do not argue with them about your Christian
        faith, rather, ask God to use you for signs and wonders so that when
        they see the power of God, they will surrender without any argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beloved, I pray that the power of God will be evident in your life and
        that He will use you to lead many people into HiS kingdom, in
        Jesus'name.
